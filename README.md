# Packet-Loss-and-Network-Congestion-Analysis

**OBJECTIVE:**<br>

 Measure packet loss and network congestion impact on data transmission.


**TASKS:**<br>

 -> **Using Wireshark:** Identify lost packets, retransmissions, and congestion events. Capture TCP and UDP traffic during high and low network load conditions.

 -> **Using Python:** Implement a script that sends bulk data packets and large packet loss rate. Analyze how network congestion affects data delivery.
